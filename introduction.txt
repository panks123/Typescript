What is typescript?

=> Typescript is a strongly typed programming language. It is a superset of Javascript. Typescript builds on top of Javascript.

First, we write the TypeScript code in .ts files . Then, you compile the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript code using a TypeScript 
compiler.

As Typescript is a superset of Javascript, so all Javascript code is valid in typescript file

Why to use typescript?
=>
- It avoids bugs during developent. We know that in Javascript there is no typechecking possible. The errors in Javascript
    will occur only during runtime. But using typescript we can avoid this because. Typescript compiler will warn us about 
    any error during development time only.

- It increases developement speed. Because we're not always stuck in fixing the bugs. Using typescript we can write the code once and we 
    do not have to worry about fixing errors again and again.

- Typescript provides us many additional features like enums, interfaces etc.

** Installation of typescript
we can install typescript as an npm package 
                                            `npm install typescript`
                                            install globally as : `npm install -g typescript`


How to run a typescript file?
=>
We cannot run a typescript file
-> first we need to compile the typescript file using the command:
                                                                    `tsc filename.ts`
-> After compilation it will generate a Javascript file which we can run using the command:
                                                                    `node filename`
